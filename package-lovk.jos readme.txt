This JSON file is a package-lock.json file, which is automatically generated by npm (Node Package Manager) when you install dependencies for a Node.js project. It provides a complete list of the packages that the project depends on, along with their specific versions and dependencies.

Overall, this file ensures that the project's dependencies are locked to specific versions, which helps maintain consistency across different environments and ensures that the project works as expected regardless of where it's deployed.
